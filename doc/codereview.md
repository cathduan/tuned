**Description of Project:** 

Our project *Tuned* is a web-app that allows users to search, log, and rate albums that they have been listening to and, in addition, track what their friends have been listening to.


**Project Status:**

Currently, we’re able to have a simple search by album title, but our search bar has no way to narrow down the search if the album title happens to be very popular. We need to add a search-by-artist feature and to display the results in a way that it scrolls if there are a lot of relevant results while also cutting out results that don’t resemble the search well.

We have a simple registration and login system that uses bcrypt to encrypt passwords. We plan to create a friend-adding system that would involve friend requests (finding a user profile and making a friend request, accepting the request, and declining the request). When friends with someone, users can see their friend’s reviews. We also would like to create a logout button. 

For our reviews, we have a 5 star rating currently with a text field for notes and also a date field. These reviews are displayed on a user’s profile, but users currently cannot edit or delete these reviews. We want to expand on our reviews so that the web-page is more interesting: adding half star reviews, potentially listing out the album’s songs and having the user choose their favorite songs of the albums, etc.

**How to Run our Program:** 

Please look at our development.txt and running.txt file to run our program. 

**Code Review Questions:** 

- Should we change our .js files into .jsx files?   
- Is our code directory structured well?  
- Is our web-app easy to navigate?   
- What would you like to see in our web-app?  
- What do you dislike about our web-app so far?  
- How do you feel about the UI?
