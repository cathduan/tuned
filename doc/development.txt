1. In your code editor, clone the repository. Make sure to have npm, node, and postgres installed. You can check with: `node -v`. Installing node also installs npm, so make sure you have npm as well: `npm -v`. 
We have one node module folder in web-app (NOT in backend), so make sure to run `npm install` in ONLY the web-app directory.  

2. In the backend: create a psql database named “tuned”. 
To do this, run: `psql postgres` and create a "tuned" database by typing: `CREATE DATABASE tuned;`. Exit postgresql by typing: `quit`   
Then, run the following line in your terminal to create a table necessary for our account system: 
    `psql -U <your username> -d tuned < account.sql`

3. Also in the backend folder, change the .env file to reflect your machine's username and password.
